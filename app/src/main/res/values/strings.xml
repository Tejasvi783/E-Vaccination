    <string name="Why">
        Parents know about the importance of car seats, baby gates, and other things that help keep their precious baby’s life safe.
        But very little know that internal safety measures are just as important as these external safety measures.
        The best internal safety measure that money can buy is vaccinations. Countless studies have shown that getting a vaccine
        is the best way to help the baby’s body fight against harmful bacterias and viruses. Currently there are 16 vaccines recommended by the CDC,
        from birth to 18 years of age. Keeping track of these vaccines can get difficult at times.
